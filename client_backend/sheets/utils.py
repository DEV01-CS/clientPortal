# This file is kept for backward compatibility but is deprecated.
# All functions have been moved to oauth_utils.py for OAuth-based authentication.
# This file will be removed in a future version.

# Note: All Google Sheets and Drive operations now use OAuth 2.0 authentication
# via oauth_utils.py. The old service account key approach is no longer supported.
